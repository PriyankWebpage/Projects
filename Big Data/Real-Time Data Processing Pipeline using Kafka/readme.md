# Project Description:
Implemented an end-to-end data engineering project leveraging Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL to analyze real-time stock market data.

# Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Designed and implemented a data pipeline using Apache Kafka to ingest real-time stock market data streams.
- Utilized Python for data processing, transformation, and enrichment within the Kafka ecosystem.
- Deployed and managed infrastructure on AWS including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Glue Data Catalog, and Athena for data storage, cataloging, and querying.
- Developed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using AWS Glue to cleanse, enrich, and organize the streaming data.
- Designed and implemented SQL queries to perform real-time analysis and generate insights from the stock market data.
