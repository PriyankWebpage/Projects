# Overview

  Image colorization is a fascinating application of deep learning, particularly with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The ability to breathe life into old black and white photographs is truly remarkable. Traditional methods relied heavily on manual labor and often resulted in inaccuracies, whereas deep learning techniques have revolutionized the process, making it more efficient and yielding more realistic results.

  By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and GANs, researchers have been able to capture intricate patterns in grayscale images and accurately map them to corresponding colors. This advancement not only saves time but also opens up possibilities for creating stunning, lifelike colorizations that resemble the original scenes.

  # Objective
  
  The primary objective of image colorization is to add color to grayscale or black and white images, thereby enhancing their visual appeal and realism. This process aims to breathe new life into old photographs, paintings, or other visual media that were originally captured or created without color.
