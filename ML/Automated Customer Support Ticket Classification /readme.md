# Overview

  Customer complaints are invaluable for financial firms, offering insights into product and service deficiencies. Swift resolution of complaints is pivotal for preserving customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, as companies expand, managing the increasing volume of support tickets becomes cumbersome. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) offer a remedy. NLP algorithms can automate ticket categorization and prioritization based on content and sentiment analysis. ML models predict optimal resolution paths, expediting support processes. This not only enhances customer experience by accelerating resolutions but also extracts valuable insights for continuous improvement.

# Objective
  The objective of this project is to revolutionize the customer support ticket system of a financial company by harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The primary aim is to automate the identification and categorization of support tickets with precision, leveraging the content within each ticket. By employing advanced NLP algorithms, the project seeks to analyze the text data, extract key information, and classify tickets into appropriate categories.
