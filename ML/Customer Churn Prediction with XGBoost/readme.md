# Customer Churn Prediction in E-commerce

Churn prediction is identifying customers that are most likely to live a service. This is important for most companies as acquiring new customers is more costlier than retaining old ones, So the results of Churn prediction help companies focus on customers that are likely to churn and develop strategies for retaining those customers.

The motive of this project is to develop a predictive model that will predict the customers likely to churn and form a strategic perspective to decrease the churn rate of customers, For example, personalized offers, discounts, loyalty rewards, or targeted marketing campaigns can be tailored to incentivize these customers to continue shopping on the platform. The ultimate goal is to retain customers, increase customer lifetime value, and ultimately enhance the profitability of the e-commerce business.

**Recommendations :** The strategy of personalized offers is effective. However it should be appropiately targeted to high-valued customers with high churn probability. If not administered properly then the company may face a hard impact on their revenue
