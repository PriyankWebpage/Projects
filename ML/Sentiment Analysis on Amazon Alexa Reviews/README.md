- Developed a comprehensive Amazon Alexa Review Sentiment Analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze over 50,000 customer reviews, achieving an accuracy of 94% with the RandomForestClassifier.
- Utilized techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, CountVectorizer for feature extraction, and PorterStemmer for text preprocessing, effectively reducing noise and dimensionality in the dataset, resulting in improved model performance.
- Implemented a robust model evaluation framework using StratifiedKFold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, ensuring the optimal configuration of model parameters.
- Created visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate sentiment distribution and key insights, enhancing the interpretability and presentation of the results.
- Deployed the final model as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input new reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions.
