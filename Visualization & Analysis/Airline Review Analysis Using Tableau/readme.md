# Overview
The overview of this exciting portfolio project focused on creating an interactive dashboard for data visualization. The dashboard allows users to select their preferred metrics with a simple click, such as average overall ratings, food ratings, or entertainment ratings. Additionally, users have access to various filters to pinpoint specific data points they're interested in, with dynamic visuals that respond to selected filters. The project provides links to the Tableau dashboard and the dataset used, encouraging users to recreate the dashboard or customize it according to their preferences. Moreover, resources like the ultimate portfolio, data roadmap, professional resume templates, and one-on-one coaching sessions are provided for further exploration. The project aims to showcase the data analysis workflow authentically. The dataset comprises two CSV files: BA reviews and countries, with BA reviews containing review data including author, date, location, and important metrics like ratings for various aspects. The countries table is used for mapping countries in the reviews table. The dashboard, as demonstrated, offers interactivity through metric selection, timeline filters, seat type options, traveler types, aircraft selection, and continent filters. It features a prominent title, summary metrics, and dynamic visuals, providing a comprehensive overview of the data.
